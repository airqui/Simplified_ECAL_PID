In this folder, we provide the steering files to:

- run the digitisation of simulated data: Digitisation.xml

- run the reconstruction of simulated data: SimReconstruction_wPS_TC.xml

- run the reconstruction of testbeam data: Reconstruction_wPS_TC.xml

- run the event display: EventDisplay.xml

Please remember to change:
- the path of slcio files in steering files
- the CALICE_INSTALL path in myMarlin

To run any file:

$ ./myMarlin <steering file>

To run the event display do:
If you have a problem crashing due to GLX. You can try to do
$ unset LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT
$ export CED_PORT=XXXX (any port between 1024-49151 can be used, if you get an error that the port is used try another one)
$ glced&

Change the parameter CED_port in the xml file to the chosen port
./myMarlin EventDisplay.xml

This repository is a junction of SiWECAL and AHCAL simulations.
The content will be (preliminary):
-Generation: dd4hep sim of a combined geometry for both detectors.
-Processors:
	-ECAL processors: Proccesing of from .slcio ECalorimetershits into "real" ECAL data.
	-HCAL processors: Proccesing of from .slcio HCalorimetershits into "real" HCAL data.
	-Joint processors: For mixing ECAL and HCAL data into a single file.
-Analysis: Junction of data and PID studies.
-Maybe more?

GENERATION
-geometry: Geometry .xml files. 
Includes original ECAL and AHCAL separate geometries of old simulations.
Includes the total geometry of 2022-06 TB with SiWECAL+AHCAL.
Includes a ILD-IDR scheme with an ECAL (30 layers) and AHCAL (48 layers) together

Note: The combined geometries are lead by one "compact" file that loads a 50x50x50m world and place the beam and detectors inside.
Beware of redefinitions inside the detectors geometries and overlapping of the geometries.

USEFUL CHECKS:
-To visualize:
"geoDisplay -compact compactgeometryfile.xml"

-To check materials, distances and possible overlappings:
"materialScan compactgeometryfile.xml x0 y0 z0 x1 y1 z1"
it will display a list of materials moving in a straight line from (x0,y0,z0) to (x1,y1,z1)

This folder contains the main scripts for the ECAL study.

*Analysis.C 
	-Def: reads the build files and prepare a single ROOT file with all the TH1F, fits and average values.
	-Func: voidanalysis (string particle)
	-Par: particle can be "e-", "pi-", "mu-"    

*run_analysis.sh
	-Def: simple bash macro to prepare the results for e-, mu- and pi- by using Analysis.C

*res_mol_plots.C
	-Def: selection of plots covering linearity study, shower profile study, and some shower characterization variables
	-Func: void res_mol_plots(string particle, bool transformed = true, bool save = false)
	-Par: particle can be "e-", "pi-", "mu-"
      	-Par: transformed true  means that the x-axis uses 1/sqrt(E) instead of E
        -Par: save true is for saving the plots in .eps files

*single_histo.C
	-Def: plot one of the TH1F variables of a specific energy, for e-, pi- and mu- simultaneously
	-Func: single_histo(TString varname, TString energy, bool save = false)
	-Par: varname is the name of the TH1F histo selected
	-Par: energy... is energy
	-Par: save plot in .eps or not
	
*plots_macro.sh
	-Def: simple bash macro to farm plots while you can focus on smth else
